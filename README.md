Unstable work-in-progress cross-platform library to detect and list PCI devices and their information. 

This library does not bind to or require libpci. As much of the library as possible is written in Rust as a general rule, except when syscalls that would require using unstable bindings have to be made.

This project uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).
